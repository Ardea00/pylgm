"""Joint latent Gaussian models: several responses stacked into one CompiledLGM.

A joint model is an ordinary :class:`~pylgm.ir.model.CompiledLGM` with more
rows. Responses stack as ``y = (y^(1), ..., y^(K))``; sub-model ``k`` occupies a
contiguous row slice. Private latent blocks are zero-padded outside their slice,
shared blocks carry scaled rows in every slice they enter, and the likelihood
becomes a row-dispatching :class:`~pylgm.likelihoods.CompiledMixture`. Both IR
invariants -- ``design == hstack(blocks)`` and ``precision == block_diag(blocks)``
-- are preserved.
